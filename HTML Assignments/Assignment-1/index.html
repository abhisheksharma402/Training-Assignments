        <p class="block-blue">
          While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it
          is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
          surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest
          of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock
          and metal.

        <img src="./images/venice.jpg" alt="Venice" />
        <p class="inline">
          Venice, the capital of northern Italy’s Veneto region, is built on
          more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has no
          roads, just canals – including the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined
          with Renaissance and Gothic palaces.

        <h3>3. Solar Eclipse</h3>
        <img src="eclipse.jpg" alt="Eclipse" />
        <p class="block-orange">
          A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun,
          and the moon casts a shadow over Earth. A solar eclipse can only take
          place during the phase of the new moon, when the moon passes directly
          between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earth’s surface.

        <h4>4. Aurora Borealis</h4>
        <img src="./images/aurora.jpg" alt="Aurora" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            An aurora, also commonly known as the polar lights, is a natural
            light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude
            regions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as
            curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire
            sky.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused
            by the solar wind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the
            solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections.
          </li>

          <li>
            These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in
            the magnetospheric plasma.

        <ol>
          <li>
            The Bromo, or Mount Bromo is an active somma volcano and part of the
            Tengger mountains, in East Java, Indonesia.
          </li>
          <li>
            At 2,329 meters it is not the highest peak of the massif, but the
            most famous.
          </li>
          <li>
            The area is one of the most visited tourist destinations in East
            Java, and the volcano is included in the Bromo Tengger Semeru
            National Park.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name Bromo comes from the Javanese pronunciation of Brahma, the
            Hindu god of creation.
